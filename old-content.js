    "Content": "Is it possible to be a Christian without prayer? Possibly, but probably no longer than a friendship can exist without conversation. Prayer is taking your requests to God. And so much more! It is the vehicle for a lifelong journey of communion with the Triune God. This app hopes to provide you with a supportive framework to do just that.\r\n\r\nThroughout the ages communities of believers of all different characters, cultures and time frames, have found ways and means in their journey with God to commune with Him. Different traditions have developed versatile prayers and liturgies to accomplish this same thing; a gold mine of experiences with God. In this app you can select elements from different traditions to compile a liturgy that supports your daily prayer. In this way you can draw from the rich well provided by fellow believers throughout history to help you in your walk with the Most High.  \r\n\r\nUnder the ‘settings’ button you can select the moments you would like to pray. For each moment you then choose the components you want to include in the prayer. We included an option to add your own categories, for example specific people you want to pray for. After every prayer we have added the suggestion for silence. It can be spent as a moment of meditation on the prayer you have just prayed. It is also a moment to expect and wait for God to respond.\r\n\r\nIf you are new to this daily routine of prayer, we encourage you to start modestly. Select a few components and start praying. It is a great joy and encouragement to develop a habit of daily prayer, be it small. One can easily expand the frequency and components of prayer when the desire grows.\r\n\r\nWe found that there may be times the liturgy doesn’t seem helpful. There can be two, equally appropriate, ways to deal with this. The power of liturgy is that it is consistent, even if our emotions and desires are not. It can be imperative to persist ‘praying your prayers’. Nevertheless, it can be equally valid to simply throw aside this app and simply burst out in exuberant praise, genuine lamentation or deafening silence. At the end of the day liturgies and apps are only means to an end.\r\n\r\nPlease browse through this app for more resources and backgrounds on prayer.\r\n\r\nMay the face of the Lord shine on you when you pray!\r",

    "Content": "This app is developed by\n\nRobin de Vos: concept and content\nDaniel Beeke: development and design\nWilma Vis:       design\n\nRobin\nThe desire to develop this app arose from a rather individual need. Born and bred in a Dutch, evangelical background I was taught to ‘read my Bible and pray everyday’, but not provided with many means to do so. The work of the Holy Spirit and spontaneity were often treated as synonymous. This, and a few other factors, made for religious life of much desire, little satisfaction, much frustration and low-level spirituality. It wasn’t until a few years ago that I discovered resources, many in different traditions than the one I was brought up in, that kindled the fire of my prayer life. I found websites and prayer books that gave me the words that I needed but could not find myself. I regularly joined the morning prayer of our local Catholic Church and there found myself being part of something older, wiser and bigger than my little self. I rediscovered the power of The Lord’s Prayer, the Psalms, confession of sins, confessions of the faith, silence and elementary rituals.\n\nI humbly consider myself only an apprentice in the area of prayer. This app is a tool that helps me to root deeper and grow in the faith. I genuinely hope it will bless you also.\n",
